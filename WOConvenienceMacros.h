//! Mark symbols for export

//! Shorthand for using the free() function to free memory previously allocated
//! with malloc(), emalloc() or similar, which then sets the pointer to NULL.
//! Effectively this macro disposes of dangling pointers. If used consistently
//! then the programmer can test if an object exists in memory by comparing its
//! pointer to NULL.
//!
//! Use of this macro can effectively disguise programming errors; as such, it
//! should only be used where changing a pointer to NULL is intended to
//! communicate someting to other parts of the codebase (and not just to
//! dispose of a dangling pointer "just in case").
//!
//! Note that because the macro performs an assignment on the supplied
//! argument, it must be a valid lvalue (variable name, for example) and not a
//! complex or compound one (such as the return result of a method, or a
//! multi-part expression).
