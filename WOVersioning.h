 *          for C and C-like languages, and property lists do not obey C's
 *          lexical rules, it is necessary to pass the "-traditional" flag to
 *          the preprocessor via the INFOPLIST_OTHER_PREPROCESSOR_FLAGS setting,
 *          and this in turn means that only traditional C comments may be used.
