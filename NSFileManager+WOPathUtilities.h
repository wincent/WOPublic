@interface NSFileManager (WOPathUtilities)

//! Objective-C wrapper for the FSFindFolder function. Returns nil on failure to find the requested path. Invokes pathForFolder:domain:create: with a \p create paramater of NO.

//! Objective-C wrapper for the FSFindFolder function. Returns nil on failure to find the requested path.
//! \param type A type constant (as defined in <Folders.h>) such as kApplicationSupportFolderType or kContextualMenuItemsFolderType
//! \param domain A domain constant (as defined in <Folders.h>) such as kUserDomain, kLocalDomain, kSystemDomain or kNetworkDomain
//! \param create Whether the folder should be created if it does not already exist

//! Objective-C wrapper for the mkdtemp function. Invokes temporaryDirectoryUsingTemplate: with an \p aString parameter obtained by calling pathForFolder:domain: with a \p type of kTemporaryFolderType and kSystemDomain \p domain and appending the path component "WOPublic.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
- (NSString *)temporaryDirectory;

//! \param aString A path template of the form "/tmp/templateXXXX" with any number of Xs
//! \return The path to the created directory, or nil on failure
//! \throws NSInternalInconsistencyException thrown if \p aString is nil
//! \throws NSInternalInconsistencyException thrown if the template length exceeds MAXPATHLEN (defined in <param.h>)
//! \throws NSMallocException thrown if memory allocation fails while trying to copy the path template
