//! Class for monitoring process lifetimes without polling
//!
//! Provides an Objective-C wrapper for Mach Port "dead name" notifications. Unlike Cocoa NSWorkspace notifications which only monitor some applications with connections to the window server (as of Mac OS X 10.2.6, this excludes applicatons with LSUIElement, and perhaps other flags, set in their Info.plist), Mach notifications are issued for all processes, even those without connections to the window server.
//!
//! The only limitation is that only processes running under the same UID as the monitoring application can be observed in this way (except for when the monitoring application is running as root). As such, the class provides a fallback method (which uses polling) for these cases.
//!
//! Required classes:
//!     - WOObject (superclass)
//!     - WOProcessManager
//!     - WOProcessSerialNumber
//!
